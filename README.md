### In-Depth Features

#### Authentication System

The application uses **NextAuth.js** for robust and secure user authentication.

- **Credentials-Based Login**: Users can sign up with an email and password. Passwords are encrypted using `bcryptjs` before being stored in the database.
- **Session Management**: NextAuth.js handles session management, keeping users logged in across browser sessions.
- **Protected Routes**: Middleware is used to protect application routes, ensuring that only authenticated users can access the main Pomodoro timer and their personal data.

#### User Profile and Settings

Each user has a dedicated profile page where they can manage their account and track their progress.

- **Public Profile Page**: Displays user's name, profile picture, and statistics like total Pomodoro sessions and completed tasks.
- **Profile Editing**: Users can update their personal information, including their name and profile picture. Profile pictures are uploaded to Vercel Blob storage.
- **Account Settings**: Users can manage their account settings, with the option to delete their account and all associated data.

#### Customization

My Pomo offers several options for users to personalize their experience.

- **Wallpaper**: Users can choose from a selection of wallpapers to set as their background, creating a more pleasant and motivating workspace. Selections are saved to the database.
- **Theme**: A theme toggle allows switching between a light and dark mode to suit user preference and reduce eye strain. The chosen theme is persisted across sessions using `next-themes`.
